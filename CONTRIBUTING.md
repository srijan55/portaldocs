## Correcting minor issues in documents

If your correcting a minor issue in a document like a typo or otherwise please ensure:
- That you fork from `dev` not master and submit the pull request against dev.
- that you make the change to the markdown under the `*/templates/*` folder and *not* under the `*/generated/*` folder.

## Prerequisite

1. Verify that npm version is 3.10.6 or greater:
    ```ts
    $>npm -v 
    ```
   To update npm version use
   ```ts 
   $>npm install npm -g
   ```
1. Install [gulp] by running 
    ```ts
    $>npm install gulp -g
    ```
1. To generate documents for Github:
    - For AzureUx-PortalFx / framework repo, execute following command from doc directory:
        ```ts
        $>cd AzureUx-PortalFx\doc
        $>npm install --no-optional
        ```
    - For github repo,  execute following command from root directory
        ```ts
        $>npm install --no-optional
        ```
1. Understanding Repository organization

    - Branches
        - The **master** branch does not contain template files (so that users don't accidently open them when searching github).  **DO NOT PUSH THE \TEMPLATES FOLDER TO THIS BRANCH.** 
        - The **master_template** branch contains templates in the **\templates** folder that are used for generating templates that get pushed to the **master** branch.
        - The **dev** branch contains the latest set of changes (that may not be ready to be published yet).

    - \articles and \[portal_sdk|gallery_sdk]\generated
    

    The  **\generated** folder is auto-generated, **do not** contribute any additional content here, instead use the *\templates* folder.
    
    - \[portal_sdk|gallery_sdk]\templates
    
    The *\templates* folder for a given SDK contains the articles formatted as markdown files and *.md* extension and makes use of [gitdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitdown) for document composition, code snippet injection, and table of contents generation.

    * **template filenames:** Begin with the service name (such as *portalfx*, *portalfx-ux*, *gallery*, *resource-provider*). Use all lowercase letters and dashes (-) to separate the words. 
    * **Media subfolders:** The parent of the *\templates* folder contains the *\media* folder, inside which are subfolders with the images for each article. The article image folders are referenced from *.md* files in the *\templates* folder.

## Authoring a document

1. Write the document within the \templates folder using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can use portalfx-creating-extensions as a template.
1. For document composition you can use [gitdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitdown).  For example `\templates\README.md` is composed of multiple documents  

    Inject content from samples or other documents using [gitdown syntax](https://github.com/gajus/gitdown).  E.g
    
    <!-- gitdown: off -->
    
        ```
        //inject the entire portalfx-howitworks.md inline where you use the following gitdown include
        {"gitdown": "include-file", "file": "../templates/portalfx-howitworks.md"}
        ```
        
    <!-- gitdown: on -->
1. To ensure all code samples remain up to date we extended gitdown syntax to support code fragment injection. To reference source code in your document directly from a *.ts, *.cs, *.pdl or *.config file use the include-section extension.
    For example,
    
    <!-- gitdown: off -->
    
        ```
        //injects the code snippet in between two comments `//config#configurationsettings` from `../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Configuration/ArmConfiguration.cs` directly inline
        {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Configuration/ArmConfiguration.cs", "section": "config#configurationsettings"}
        ```
        
    <!-- gitdown: on -->

## Generating documents for Github 

### Partner Teams

#### Gallery
To generate github content for **gallery**:
```
$>npm run gallery
```

### Portal Team

To generate auxdocs classic content and new github content run.  
**Note**: First run must be done as `Administrator` to generate symlink to SamplesExtension to allow for shorter reference paths for snippet injection
    
```
$>npm run docs
```

To verify all links work use
```
$>npm run docs -- --verifyurl
```

If you have added new links that internal or authenticated or dummy then you can exclude checks for them by including them in  urlsToSkip array on line 250 of gulpcommon.js.
