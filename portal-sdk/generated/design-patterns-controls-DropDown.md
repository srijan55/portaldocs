<a name="basics"></a>
### Basics
A DropDown is a list in which the selected item is always visible, and the others are visible on demand by clicking a drop-down button.

### When to use
DropDowns are used to simplify the design and make a choice within the UI. When closed, only the selected item is visible. When users click the drop-down button, all the options become visible. To change the value, users open the list and click another value or use the arrow keys (up and down) to select a new value.

DropDown offers the following options:
* Grouping of items 
* Filtering / Searching 
* Multiselect + Select all
* HTML formatting of items

### Best practices

<a name="best-practices-do"></a>
#### Do

* Use a DropDown when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
* Use shortened statements or single words as options.
* Use a DropDown when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).
