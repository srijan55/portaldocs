## Create Flow table

CreateFlow table in Kusto database **AzPtlCosmos** called **CreateFlows**

Accessible through using the function: **GetCreateFlows(startDate: datetime, endDate: datetime)**

[Note] The AzPtlCosmos database **does not** contain test traffic or unnofficial creates which don't go through the Marketplace or +New.

### GetCreateFlows

<a name="create-telemetry-create-flow-functions-getcreateflows-summary"></a>
#### Summary
`GetCreateFlows(startDate: datetime, endDate: datetime)`

This function returns the list of Portal Azure service deployment lifecycles, also known as 'create flows', for a given time range.
* Each create flow represents the lifecycle of a create with the beginning being marked by the moment the create blade is opened and ending the moment that the create has been concluded and logged by the Portal.
* Data for each create is curated and joined between Portal data logs and available ARM deployment data logs.

<a name="create-telemetry-create-flow-functions-getcreateflows-common-use-cases"></a>
#### Common Use Cases
* Identifying the number of creates completed for a given Extension or for a particular Azure marketplace gallery package.
* Calculating the percentage of successful creates initiated by an Extension's create blade.
* Debugging failed deployments by retrieving error message information logged for failed creates.
* Calculating the number of creates that were abandoned by the user before being initiated and completed.
* Identifying creates initiated by a given user id.
* Calculating the average create duration by data center.

# <a name="FAQ"></a>FAQ

<a name="a-name-faq-a-faq-i-want-to-query-for-a-large-time-frame-14d-but-i-m-getting-the-error-accumulated-string-too-large"></a>
### I want to query for a large time frame (+14d) but I&#39;m getting the error, <code>‘accumulated string too large’</code>

This is a low level internal Kusto constraint which limits the amount of records we are able work with across multiple clusters/databases at a time. This limit is more noticeable now because we are connecting large amounts of data directly with ARM (data is stored on a different cluster).  

We have worked with Kusto on how to work around this for teams/users who wish to query large data sets (like 30 days) and they have a solution for us which you can use on your query:

```sql
set notruncation;
```

Add this to your query and it will let you query larger data sets. 

We are hoping that we can work with Kusto to have a configuration in our function set for this, but for now this is the only option available.

If you are still unable to execute your query over the time you want, try breaking up the query into multiple time frames and union the results. Here is an example of a 30 day query broken up into 2:

```sql
set notruncation;
let startTime = datetime(2017-09-01);
let endTime = datetime(2017-10-01);
let midTime = startTime + ((endTime - startTime) / 2);
GetCreateFlows(startTime, midTime)
| where Extension  == "HubsExtension"
| where Blade == "CreateEmptyResourceGroupBlade"
| where ExecutionStatus == "Failed"
| union (
GetCreateFlows(midTime, endTime)
| where Extension  == "HubsExtension"
| where Blade == "CreateEmptyResourceGroupBlade"
| where ExecutionStatus == "Failed"
)
```

Note: Worried about duplicates caused from unions? Just remember the end date is exclusive for GetCreateFlows() and follow the pattern as demonstrated in the example above.

<a name="a-name-faq-a-faq-i-m-getting-the-error-request-execution-has-timed-out-on-the-service-side-and-was-aborted"></a>
### I&#39;m getting the error, <code>Request execution has timed-out on the service side and was aborted.</code>

The curernt Kusto timeout limit for a query is 4:30. If this is happening when you are simply calling one of the CreateFlow functions then thecluster could be under stress or one of the dependent services is down at the moment. 

Try again after waiting some time or at non-peak hours which are between 9am-10am & 3pm-5pm.
