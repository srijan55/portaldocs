## Updating your extension to a newer version of the SDK

External partners can download and install the NuGet packages when they install and use **Visual Studio 2015**. For more information, see [portalfx-extensions-getting-started-procedure.md](portalfx-extensions-getting-started-procedure.md). The packages that are installed are located in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\PortalSDK\Packages` directory.

### Updating your NuGet Packages

* In Visual Studio
1. If external outside of Microsoft:
   1. Install the latest version of the Portal SDK MSI, as specified in [downloads.md](https://aka.ms/portalfx/downloads). Optional for internal teams, Required for teams outside of Microsoft.
1. In Visual Studio open your Solution and select `Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet packages for Solution…`.
1. Select all `Microsoft.Portal.*` NuGet packages.
1. Click `Update`.
1. Build and fix any breaking changes, as described in [Breaking changes](https://aka.ms/portalfx/breaking).

* In CoreXT
1. Find the latest SDK version number from the SDK downloads document located [here](https://aka.ms/portalfx/downloads).

1. Update your `package.config` to the latest version of the SDK.

1. Run `init.cmd`.

    **NOTE**: Your $(Pkg*) references in your `csproj` file  should automatically update to point at the newest restored NuGet.

1. Copy over `/Content` files to get latest `*.d.ts` and `*.pde` files.

    **NOTE**:  CoreXT does not copy content files. Typically, internal teams use either a `<Target />` or a `NuGetContentRestore` task to rehydrate the Content files from their CxCache.

1. Build and fix any breaking changes.

## References

The Azure Portal SDK ships framework assemblies, tools, test framework and extension [PDE](portalfx-extensions-glossary-onboarding.md) files as NuGet packages. It also provides the capability to ship extensions as NuGet packages. This allows extensions to invoke blades and parts from other extensions at runtime. For more information about sharing  extensions as NuGet packages, see [portalfx-pde-publish.md](portalfx-pde-publish.md).

### Configure NuGet package sources for development

In order to download the NuGet packages as part of an extension, developers can choose between CoreXT compatible package sources or consume the packages installed locally by the MSI. Choose a configuration that applies to your extension development context.

<a name="azure-portal-sdk-packages-references-configure-nuget-package-sources-for-development-microsoft-internal-nuget-feed"></a>
#### Microsoft Internal NuGet Feed

Portal SDK NuGet packages are published to the Microsoft internal NuGet feed located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/nugetfeed](https://aka.ms/portalfx/nugetfeed).  Depending on your internal build system, the configuration of how to consume this feed will vary.  For the latest guidance on consuming the feed within your build system, consult your build system's documentation. For those using 1ES systems, see the NuGet in 1ES guide located at [https://www.1eswiki.com/wiki/NuGet_in_1ES](https://www.1eswiki.com/wiki/NuGet_in_1ES).

You can also [browse the feed in VSTS](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/Azure%20Portal/_packaging?feed=Official%40Local&_a=feed).

#### Getting the NuGet packages externally

PortalSDK NuGet packages are only published to Microsoft internal NuGet feeds.  If you do not have access to those feeds such as the one mentioned above you will need use those NuGet packages that are included in the Azure Portal SDK.  This is the recommended path for  [third party extension developers](portalfx-extensions-glossary-onboarding.md).

Installing the Portal SDK MSI will unpack the NuGet packages to a default location of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\PortalSDK\packages` and will setup a NuGet package source named PortalSDK that points to that location.  Any subsequent actions performed in **Visual Studio** or the **NuGet** command line will also search the new local PortalSDK feed in program files for Portal-related NuGet packages.

### Available Packages

Packages used by extension developers are separated into the following categories.

* [Development](#development)
* [Publishing in the marketplace](#publishing-in-the-marketplace)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Shared Packages](#shared-packages)
* [Deprecated packages](#deprecated-packages)

The following sections describe the various packages by category. All packages are available both in the Portal SDK MSI and through the deep-linked package source. Some packages are shipped as NuGet packages, and others as Node modules.  All packages in the following tables are NuGet packages unless they are annotated to be a node module.

### Development

After installation, NuGet packages that are used for development can be viewed in the `packages.config` file or in the NuGet **Package Manager** tool in **Visual Studio**.  Node modules can be viewed  in `package.json`.

### Shared packages

Portal Definition Exports, or PDE's, are extensions that are maintained by teams other than the Ibiza team and your team. These extensions are available for your use. This list of packages are contributed to by extension developers who are exposing functionality from their extension by way of shipping their PDE. The absence of an extension package from the list does not imply that the package does not exist, or does not ship. To verify whether an extension ships a NuGet package, reach out to the respective teams at [portalfx-extensions-contacts.md](portalfx-extensions-contacts.md) or [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice).

| Package | Purpose | Document |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| [Microsoft.Portal.Extensions.KeyVault](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_packaging?feed=Official&_a=package&package=Microsoft.Portal.Extensions.KeyVault&protocolType=NuGet) | Blades and parts shared by the KeyVault extension. | [portalfx-pde-keyvault.md](portalfx-pde-keyvault.md) |

### Deprecated packages

The following NuGet packages have been deprecated. Do not use these packages when building new extensions. 

| Package | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| Microsoft.Portal.Azure.Website | Sideload your extension instead, as specified in [top-extensions-sideloading.md](top-extensions-sideloading.md). |
| Microsoft.Portal.Azure.WebsiteNoAuth | Sideload your extension instead, as specified in [top-extensions-sideloading.md](top-extensions-sideloading.md). |
| Microsoft.Portal.Framework.Scripts | Use Microsoft.Portal.TestFramework.UnitTest instead, as specified in [top-extensions-unit-test.md](top-extensions-unit-test.md). |
| Microsoft.Portal.Tools.Etw | The recommended practice is to use the Extension Hosting Service as specified in [top-extensions-hosting-service.md](top-extensions-hosting-service.md) instead of custom deployment, as specified in [top-extensions-custom-deployment.md](top-extensions-custom-deployment.md). If you are self-hosting your extension, then this package provides the `EtwRelatedFilesUtility.exe` tool and sample configurations.  | 
| Microsoft.Portal.TypeMetadata | Author typemetadata directly instead of using this package, as specified in [portalfx-data-typemetadata.md#non-generated-type-metadata](portalfx-data-typemetadata.md#non-generated-type-metadata). |
| [Microsoft.Portal.Tools.ContentUnbundler](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/Azure%20Portal/_packaging?feed=Official%40Local&package=Microsoft.Portal.Tools.ContentUnbundler&protocolType=NuGet&_a=package) | This NuGet has been deprecated. The recommended practice is to generate HostingService artifacts as part of native build. [Extension Hosting Service](top-extensions-hosting-service.md). |
