# Icons
Icons are used in commands, resource menus, blades, titles and portal navigation. The portal places some special requirements on the types of icons you can use. All icons are required to be SVG files so that icons will scale on high resolution devices, and for automatic theming.
In many cases, you will not need to provide your own icons, as the SDK framework includes a large library of icons for common uses.

* Use flat icons for commands
* Use polychromatic icons for resource menu, blades, titles and portal navigation.
