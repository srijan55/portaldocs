# Create a resource
The "create a resource" pattern provides a simple, intuitive and quick experience for creating resources by using a minimum number of fields and providing default values. The pattern also enables users to walk through detailed configuration options in order to manually set many resource options. The experience uses a fullscreen page with tabs to separate related configuration steps and guide the user during the create process.

## Solution
The resource create pattern enables quick configuration of a new resource by using a minimum number of fields and providing default values. The pattern also enables users to walk through detailed configuration options in order to manually set many resource options.  The experience uses a fullscreen page with tabs to separate related configuration steps and guide the user during the create process.

### Example uses
These Azure resources are good examples of this design pattern 

<ul>
<li>Create a <a href="https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/microsoft.freeaccountvirtualmachine" target="_blank">Free account virtual machine</a></li>
<li>Create an <a href="https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.IotHub" target="_blank">IoT hub</a></li>

## Anatomy
<!-- TODO UX get screenshot that includes "Learn more" links in section text -->
<div style="max-width:800px">
<img alttext="Resource create anatomy" src="../media/design-patterns-resource-create/resource-create-anatomy.png"  />
</div>

The resource create experience contains:
1. Tabs with descriptive and supportive text and learn more links to switch between logical input steps
2. Input fields divided into logical sections with concise, instructional text for each section
3. Footer navigation with buttons to navigate to previous and next tabs and submit the form

<a name="anatomy-tab-layout"></a>
<a name="anatomy-tab-layout"></a>
### Tab Layout

Descriptions: The top of each tab should include a brief description about the content to follow. When possible include `Learn more` links to relevant docs.

Section Headers: Used to separate common settings within a tab including a description for the section.

Alignment: Stack labels above controls if the screen resolution < 700px.
	
Info Bubbles: If you have input fields that may not be immediately familiar to users, include an info bubble that shows more information.

<a name="anatomy-sections-that-group-input-fields"></a>
<a name="anatomy-sections-that-group-input-fields"></a>
### Sections that group input fields
When creating a form that includes several fields pertaining to a certain subject, you can group them into a section with a header that gives the user a clear indication of what they’re being asked for. You can also add explanatory text just below the group header if the task may not be immediately clear to the user.
Section headers should follow sentence case, with only the first letter capitalized unless the words are proper nouns, acronyms or brand names.

</div>

<a name="anatomy-sub-create-in-a-context-pane"></a>
### Sub create in a context pane
Context panes can be used for sub creates within the create flow. The sub create allows users to configure services or to create resources that are related to the main resource that's being created, without losing the overall context.

<img alttext="Tabs" src="../media/design-patterns-resource-create/subcreate.png"  />
</div>

<a name="anatomy-footer-navigation"></a>
<a name="anatomy-footer-navigation"></a>
### Footer navigation
The footer nav contains the call to action (CTA) for creating the resource, as well as two buttons used for navigating between tabs. If your resource supports created templates, you can include an affordance for that in the footer nav.

## Behavior
Use the tabs & sections to organize content. The `Basics` tab should be the starting point for all creates and contain essential configuration info. The design should allow for quick resource creation at any time with unrestricted navigation between tabs. Enabling users to freely navigate the tabs reduces the friction for users looking to learn about your resource.  The combination of quick creation and tab exploration can lead to additional resource deployments over time.

### Tabs
Use the tabs & sections to organize content. The Basics tab should be the starting point for all creates and contain essential configuration info. The design should allow for quick resource creation at any time with unrestricted navigation between tabs. Enabling users to freely navigate the tabs reduces the friction for users looking to learn about your resource. The combination of quick creation and tab exploration can lead to additional resource deployments over time.

Most creates should have a minimum of 3 tabs; `Basics`, `Tags`, `Review + create`.  All other tabs are optional.  Tab naming should follow sentence case, with only the first letter capitalized unless the words are proper nouns, acronyms or brand names.

<div style="max-width:800px">
<img alttext="Tabs" src="../media/design-patterns-resource-create/Tabs.png"  />
</div>

<a name="behavior-tabs-basics"></a>
<a name="behavior-tabs-basics"></a>
#### Basics
The first tab contains fields required for creating the resource. Set default values when possible to eliminate additional time spent on create.

The `Basics` tab should contain the typical fields for Azure resources
* Project Details - Groups the `Subscription` and `Resource Group` controls.  The default text for Project Details is `Select the subscription to manage deployed resources and costs. Use resource groups like folders to organize and manage all your resources.`
* `Name` - the name of the resource
* `Region` - used to be referred to as Location
* SKU/Cost/Pricing tier - enable the user to control the cost of the resource

If your resource comes in different sizes or SKUs, make sure to include the pricing tier in your create flow. To make it easy for users to update resources sizes and SKUs, include the pricing tier in the manage a resource experience.
<!-- TODO UX add info on pricing tier using grid for easy comparison -->

<a name="behavior-tabs-optional-tabs"></a>
<a name="behavior-tabs-optional-tabs"></a>
#### Optional tabs
Additional tabs are used to organize optional settings specific to your resource.  All optional tabs should be after the `Basics` tab and before the `Tags tab.  Tabs should have short names, typically a noun. Tab naming should follow sentence case, with only the first letter capitalized unless the words are proper nouns, acronyms or brand names.

<a name="behavior-tabs-tags"></a>
<a name="behavior-tabs-tags"></a>
#### Tags
Many enterprises are starting to create subscription and resource group polices that require tagging resources at create time.  Not including the `Tags` tab will block those users from deploying resources using the portal.  The `Tags` tab is always the penultimate tab.  The `Tags` tab contains the tags control, which allows users to assign key value pairs to the selected Resource Types.	

![alt-text](../media/top-extensions-create/Tags.png "Tags control")

<a name="behavior-tabs-review-create"></a>
<a name="behavior-tabs-review-create"></a>
#### Review + Create
Allowing the user to verify all settings prior to submission ensures accuracy and reduces the need for user redeployments.  Use the summary control to help organize content from multiple tabs.  Disable the create button until validation succeeds.  The `Review + Create` tab is always the last tab.

![alt-text](../media/top-extensions-create/Review.png "Review + Create")


<a name="post-create"></a>
<a name="post-create"></a>
## Post create
The post create page provides realtime deployment status, help with troubleshooting, and improved error display. Best practice is to include additional information here to help the user learn more about the resource being created, as well as related Azure resources.

<img alttext="Tabs" src="../media/design-patterns-resource-create/post-create.png"  />
</div>

<a name="do"></a>
<a name="do"></a>
## Do
-   Put all required fields on the first tab so the user can quickly create your resource

-   Mark required fields with the red asterisk

 - Include info bubbles if there are input fields that may not be immediately familiar

<a name="don-t"></a>
<a name="don-39-t"></a>
## Don&#39;t
-   Don’t just map your existing create experience to separate tabs.

-   Don't include lengthy and unclear explanatory text. It should be used to clarify and set expectations in a few short sentences

# For developers
Developers can use the following information to get started implementing this pattern

<a name="for-developers-tips-and-tricks"></a>
<a name="for-developers-tips-and-tricks"></a>
## Tips and tricks

-   Set a maximimum width of 600px for the page area that contains input fields
-   Screen resolution - If screen resolution is less than 700px, set left aligned = false
-   To include the visual connector between Subscription and resource group, set `Nested = True` on the resource group control.
